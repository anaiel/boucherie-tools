# format-training-for-discord

App using the Notion API to translate a Notion database (containing the content of my roller derby league's training program) into Discord copy-pastable text (to share with my teammates).

Bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vite.dev/)/[SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/)

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
